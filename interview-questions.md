# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props in React are used to pass the state of one class(parent) to another(child).

  Researched answer: Props is short for properties. Props are arbitrary inputs accepted by react components.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: a DOM event is user input that is interpreted. A Dom event is interpreted by the code which causes a diff in the DOM. React will then update only the node(s) that has changes.

  Researched answer: DOM events can also be triggered by the browser (in addition to the user). Dom events are changes.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming is programming using objects(obviously). More specifically, in OOP objects hold a state that is updated by accessing and changing the data held at certain keys at certain times or when certain inputs are recognized.

  Researched answer: OOP is useful because objects have a feature that allows them to access and modify the data within itself using their own procedures.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: a float is a number that has decimal places. for example 4.5 or 5.66, while an integer has no decimal places.

  Researched answer: Ruby will consider a number as a float even if there is only a zero after the decimal point. for example 5.0 is considered a float, but 5 is an integer.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means there is no 'return' needed. Ruby will simply return the last line of the function or conditional.

  Researched answer: Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression.
